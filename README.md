This was an individual project from the CISC 375 Web Development class at University of St. Thomas. The project's goal was to build a static personal website using HTML, CSS, and Foundation framework. The website should have a home page, a project demonstration page, a resume page, and personal page to share more about myself. The website is also responsive with smaller screensizes like phone or tablets.

This project was for a technical challenge round in the interview process for the Engineering Co-op position at Zendesk in July 2021. The project was to build an app that used Zendesk API to request and display tickets information with a couple of features like pagination if there were more than 25 tickets and viewing individual ticket information option.

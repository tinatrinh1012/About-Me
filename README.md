# Hi there :wave: Welcome to my programming portfolio :computer:

Throughout my time at University of St. Thomas (2019-2023) as a Computer Science student, I've worked on a few different programming projects for classes and self-learning purposes. The 3 presented programming projects here are to showcase skills and knowledge that I've gained in web development and object-oriented programming. The first two projects, Personal Website and Ticket Viewer CLI App, are the ones that I worked on by myself. The third project, St.Paul Crime Full Stack Web App, is a group project from a class, to which I contributed.

The [Personal Website Project](https://github.com/tinatrinh1012/tinatrinh1012.github.io) was a class project, where we learned to build and style static website using basic HTML and Foundation CSS Framework. The website is hosted on Github and is responsive to different screen sizes. I spent some extra time to give the website a decent design and use it as my official personal website. Check out the website at [tinatrinh1012.github.io](https://tinatrinh1012.github.io/), where I share a bit about myself, career, and passion.

The [Zendeks Ticket Viewer CLI Project](https://github.com/tinatrinh1012/ZendeskCodingChallenge) was a coding challenge for an internship interview. It was my first time learning how to work and interact with API and new Java libraries to help make HTTP requests and write Java unit tests. The project's allowed time was 1 week. Although it was only for a job interview, I think I've learned a lot from this project, especially about time management and project planning.

To learn or investigate more about crimes that happened in St. Paul area, one may find my third project helpful. The [St. Paul Crime Incidents Web App](https://github.com/AashishBharath/StPaulCrimeData) presents incidents data from the [St. Paul Crime Incident Report public dataset](https://information.stpaul.gov/datasets/stpaul::crime-incident-report/about) and dynamically display incident location data on a map. Incidents data can be filtered based on incident types, neighborhood names, start time and end time of the day, or within a specifc date range. Users also have the ability to delete and submit a new an incident to the database.

## :one: Personal Website - Static Web Pages

Repository Link: https://github.com/tinatrinh1012/tinatrinh1012.github.io

Website Link: https://tinatrinh1012.github.io/

This was an individual project from the CISC 375 Web Development class at University of St. Thomas. The project's goal was to build a static personal website using HTML, CSS, and Foundation framework. The website should have a home page, a project demonstration page, a resume page, and personal page to share more about myself. The website is also responsive with smaller screensizes like phone or tablets.

## :two: Zendesk Coding Challenge - Ticket Viewer CLI App

Repository Link: https://github.com/tinatrinh1012/ZendeskCodingChallenge 

This project was for a technical challenge round in the interview process for the Engineering Co-op position at Zendesk in July 2021. The project was to build an app that used Zendesk API to request and display tickets information with a couple of features like pagination if there were more than 25 tickets and viewing individual ticket information option. It's a command-line interface (CLI) app using Java and JUnit for writing unit tests. 

## :three: Full Stack Vue.js Node.js App 

Repository Link: https://github.com/AashishBharath/StPaulCrimeData & https://github.com/AashishBharath/StPaulCrimeVue
Demo Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SnJWiJLPZ8

This was a group project, also from CISC 375 class, where we build a full stack web app using Node.js, Express.js, and sqlite3 for the backend, and Vue.js for the frontend to display and interact with St. Paul crime data. The app features include retrieving and displaying crime data with filters, adding new incident, deleting incidents, and an interactive map of St. Paul crime incidents location.  -->
